    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy, fail-proof omelette recipe is truly the best. With a variety of filling suggestions, you will learn how to make an omelet at home that’s even more delicious than your favorite breakfast restaurant (but so simple)!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ tbsp Salted Butter</li>
      <li>3 Eggs</li>
      <li>Pinch of Salt and Pepper</li>
      <li>¼ cup Sharp Cheddar Cheese Shredded</li>
      <li>1 tsp Minced Garlic</li>
      <li>2 tbsp Minced Onion</li>
      <li>2 slices Bacon Diced</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook bacon (or sausage), garlic and onion over medium heat until bacon is cooked and onion is soft (5-8 minutes). Set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs vigorously until they are homogenous (uniform throughout). Whisk in salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in an 8” nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Add whisked eggs and swirl the pan until they are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat until the eggs begin to set. Once they begin to set, use a spatula to gently push the edges in slightly and swirl the pan so that any uncooked eggs on the top pour over the sides to the edges of the pan and cook.</li>
        <li>Once the omelette is mostly set (about 5-6 minutes), carefully flip it and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cheese over the top of the omelette.</li>
        <li>Then, add the toppings on one half of the omelette, and fold the other half over the toppings.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
